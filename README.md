In the Urban cities where the fare is lower there appears to be more rides versus in Rural areas the fare is higher with less rides and drivers.   
Urban cities may have more rides also because of the population.

##Recommendations
The disparity in the city types may be due to population; however, it also may be due to lack of awareness.   Some people may not know in the Suburbs and Rural areas
that Pyber is available to them.   
Marketing to those areas via social media may be helpful.
Also, allowing the community of the Rural and Suburbs know that there are job opportunties available to be a driver.
You may also offer rate specials or coupons for people in the rural areas.   They may feel using Pyber may be too expensive to go to town.
